Transload your post images to ImageShack to save server resources.

== Description ==

ImageShack transload is a WordPress plugin that makes it easy to include images in your articles.

As the price of the server varies according to bandwidth consumption, it is normal try to minimize the amount of data traffic from the server where you host your site. One way of doing this is to host all images on external Web sites created specifically for this purpose. Those sites are known as CDN (Content Delivery Network).

The CDN ImageShack is a specialized in images. You send your pictures back and get a link back. Using this link you can put images in their articles without spending the bandwidth of your server. Every time they access the article containing the picture, it will be loaded from ImageShack, and not from your server.

Using ImageShack transload, just drag the image you want to insert into your article, in the editing area. When you click the "Publish" or "Reload", all images that you entered in your article will be automatically sent to ImageShack. In sending the images are also optimized. Besides being smaller and not using the bandwidth of your server, the final page will load will be lighter and faster.

You can also register your username and password in the ImageShack Plugin settings. By doing this the images will be sent to your account ImageShack, letting you control all the pictures already uploaded to ImageShack.
